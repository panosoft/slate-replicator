# slate-replicator
Postgresql Event Source Table Replicator For slate

The purpose of the slate-replicator is to copy a table of immutable events from a Postgresql Event Source database to an events table in one or more Destination databases.

Replication is triggered by events being added to the Event Source database events table.

slate-replicator requires node version 6 or greater.

# Installation
> npm install -g @panosoft/slate-replicator

# Usage

#### Start slate-replicator

    slate-replicator [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                 output usage information
    -c, --config-filename <s>  configuration file name
    --dry-run                  if specified, display run parameters and end program without starting replicator

#### Stop slate-replicator

    ^C to stop replicator

The replicator copies in a transactional manner so it can be stopped at any time

## Configuration file

### Sample configuration file

```javascript
  var config = {
    // optional parameter.  maximum events written to the replicationDestinations events tables per database operation.  minimum value:  10000.
    maxEventsPerWrite: 10000,
    // optional parameter.  database connection timeout in milliseconds.  default value:  15000.
    connectTimeout: 15000,
    // connection parameters to immutable event source database events table
    eventSource: {
      host: 'localhost',
      databaseName: 'sourceDb',
      // optional parameter.  connection attempt will fail if missing and needed by database.
      user: 'user1',
      // optional parameter.  connection attempt will fail if missing and needed by database.
      password: 'pass1'
    },
    // array of connection parameters to one or more replication databases events tables.  one replication destination is required.
    replicationDestinations: [
      {
        host: 'localhost',
        databaseName: 'replicationDb1',
        // optional parameter.  connection attempt will fail if missing and needed by database.
        user: 'user1',
        // optional parameter.  connection attempt will fail if missing and needed by database.
        password: 'pass1'
      },
      {
          host: 'localhost',
          databaseName: 'replicationDb2',
          // optional parameter.  connection attempt will fail if missing and needed by database.
          user: 'user1',
          // optional parameter.  connection attempt will fail if missing and needed by database.
          password: 'pass1'
    ]
  };
  module.exports = config;
  ```
#### maxEventsPerWrite
> An optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of events that can be written to the events table in each `replicationDestination` database per write operation.  Default and minimum value is `10000`.

#### connectTimeout
> An optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of milliseconds to wait to connect to a database before throwing an Error.  Default value is `15000` milliseconds.


#### eventSource
  > Parameters used to connect to the Event Source database

| Field         | Required | Description                
| ------------- |:--------:| :---------------------------------------
| host          | Yes      | database server name
| databaseName  | Yes      | database name containing the events table         
| user          | No       | database user name.  connection attempt will fail if missing and required by database.
| password      | No       | database user password.  connection attempt will fail if missing and required by database.

#### replicationDestinations
> An array of one or more objects containing parameters identical to `eventSource` parameters.  These parameters are used to connect to `replicationDestination` databases which must contain a table called `events`.  The `replicationDestination` databases are where the events from the `eventSource` database `events` table are copied.

# Database Schema
All databases used in the replication process must have an `events` table that has the same schema.

The `eventSource` database has more functionality than the `replicationDestination` databases.

The `events` table in the `eventSource` database has a trigger and trigger function that support the notification process mentioned in the [`Run`](#Run) section.

Also the `eventSource` database has an `id` table that is used to provide values for the `id` column in the `events` table.

There is also an `insert_events` function in the `eventSource` database that is used to insert events into the `events` table in a transactional manner.

For further database schema information, please refer to [`slate-init-db`](https://github.com/panosoft/slate-init-db).

# Operations
### Start up validations
- Configuration parameters are validated
- The locations for the `eventSource events` table and `replicationDestination events` tables are validated, e.g. the source and destinations are unique
- If the `events` table in any `replicationDestination` database is non-empty, then the first event in that table must be equal the first event in the `eventSource` database
- Row counts and maximum id column values in the `eventSource` and `replicationDestination events` tables are checked for consistency
- If the `slate-replicator` is started in `--dry-run` mode then it will validate and display configuration parameters without running the replicator
- All start-up information and any configuration errors are logged

### Run
The `slate-replicator` listens for notifications generated by an `events` table trigger in the `eventSource` database using the `Postgresql LISTEN` command. This triggers the replication process. Notifications are generated by the `Postgresql pg_notify` function when events are inserted into the `events` table in the `eventSource` database.

Each time the replication process is triggered, it will replicate all events that are missing from the `replicationDestination` database.

### Shutdown
The `slate-replicator` can be shutdown using the `Cntrl-C` keystroke.

### Exceptions
The `slate-replicator` process ends when any exception occurs.  Since the replication process is transactional, the `slate-replicator` can be restarted at any time.  If an exception stops the `slate-replicator`, some other process needs to start it again.

### Logging
The `slate-replicator` uses the `bunyan` logging library to log all exceptions and informational messages. Logging is done to the console as the replicator was designed to be run in a Docker container.

### Test Tools
There are two Testing tools, `loadPersonData.js` and `eventsDiff.js`, provided in the test directory to aid testing the `slate-replicator`:

#### loadPersonData.js
This program can be used to test `slate-replicator` by loading the `events` table in the `eventSource` database with realistic looking event data supplied by using the [`faker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) library.

It is started by running `slate-loadPersonData [options]`.

It also creates validation data in each event that can be optionally checked by the eventsDiff.js program to provide a more thorough validation of `slate-replicator` processing.

#### eventsDiff.js
This program validates the data in each `events` table being compared, and then compares data in the `events` table in the `eventSource` database with data in the `events` table in the `replicationDestination` database as specified in the configuration file.

It is started by running `slate-eventsDiff [options]`.

This program can be run such that all `events` data row differences can be reported or the program can stop after detecting a configurable number of `events` data row differences.

The `loadPersonData` and `eventsDiff` programs can be used to test `slate-replicator` in the following manner:
- Run the `loadPersonData` program to create data in the `events` table in the `eventSource` database.  Multiple `loadPersonData` programs can be run at the same time for a more robust test.
- Run the `slate-replicator` to replicate the test data to an `events` table in a `replicationDestination` database, and stop the `slate-replicator` using `Cntrl-C` when replication is complete.  The `slate-replicator` program can be started before, during, or after the `loadPersonData` program(s) are running.
- Configure and run the `eventsDiff` program to validate and compare data in the two `events` tables processed by the replicator program.  If the replicator ran properly, then there should be no validation errors or event differences reported by the `eventsDiff` program.

#### loadPerfTestData.js
There is an additional Testing tool, `loadPerfTestData.js`, provided in the test directory that was written to create data in the `events` table in order to test database and index performance.

It is started by running `slate-loadPerfTestData [options]`.

Further information regarding how to use the test tools can be found by running the test tool using `--help` for `[options]` or by reading the comments in the test programs.
